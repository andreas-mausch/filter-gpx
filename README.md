I want to know how much time I've spent in a specific area.
I use it together with PhoneTrack in my Nextcloud to track myself.

The tool takes a GPX file from PhoneTrack, you enter some bounding coordinates
and it will tell you how much time you've spent there, grouped by day.

```
./filter-gpx.kscript --topleft=53.1234,9.1234 --bottomright=53.4321,9.4321
```
